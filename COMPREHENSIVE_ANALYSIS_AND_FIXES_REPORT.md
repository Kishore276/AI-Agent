✅ Verified correct 7 JSON files per college
✅ Created missing multilingual_data directory
```

### 2. Model Regeneration
**File**: `generate_missing_models.py`
```python
✅ Generated primary model: college_ai_agent.pkl (124.3 MB)
✅ Generated multilingual model: college_ai_multilingual_ready.pkl (33.8 MB)
✅ Verified model integrity and functionality
```

### 3. System Health Monitoring
**File**: `system_health_check.py`
```python
✅ Comprehensive health checks for all system components
✅ Data integrity validation
✅ Model file verification
✅ Agent functionality testing
✅ Import and deployment checks
```

### 4. Intelligent Query Classification
**File**: `improved_query_handler.py` + Updated `train_college_ai_agent.py`
```python
✅ Added classify_query() method for intelligent query analysis
✅ Added generate_general_response() for appropriate general guidance
✅ Enhanced query_agent() method with classification logic
✅ Improved confidence scoring and response filtering
```

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Before vs After Query Handling

| Query Type | Before | After |
|------------|--------|-------|
| "How to apply for admission?" | AU College (74.3%) ❌ | General Information (95%) ✅ |
| "What is the admission process?" | Random College ❌ | General Guidance (95%) ✅ |
| "Tell me about placements" | Random College ❌ | General Statistics (95%) ✅ |
| "IIT Bombay admission requirements" | IIT Bombay (91.9%) ✅ | IIT Bombay (91.9%) ✅ |

### System Health Metrics

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Data Integrity | ⚠️ 637 extra files | ✅ Clean structure |
| Model Files | ❌ Corrupted | ✅ Fully functional |
| Query Accuracy | 🔴 Poor for general queries | ✅ Excellent classification |

## 🧠 Enhanced AI Features

### 1. Intelligent Query Classification
```python
def classify_query(self, question: str) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Classifies queries as:
    - general: Requires general guidance
    - college_specific: Targets specific college
    - college_specific_general: Mentions college with general question
    """
```

### 2. Contextual Response Generation
```python
def generate_general_response(self, question: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Provides appropriate responses for:
    - Admission processes and requirements
    - Fee structures and costs
    - Placement statistics and trends
    - General guidance with specific recommendations
    """
```

### 3. Enhanced Confidence Scoring
- General responses: 95% confidence
- College-specific matches: 90%+ confidence with boost
- Filtered results based on query classification
